Whistle-Unofficial-API
======================

[Whistle](www.whistle.com) is like a fitbit for dogs... I did some investigating and discovered some of their API calls and made my own node module to make use of them.

This is a demo for using the [node-whistle](https://github.com/oehokie/node-whistle) [npm module](https://www.npmjs.org/package/node-whistle)

Definitely unofficial...
